## Our mission:
We are a group of students, looking to help our community by creating a dashboard and a website that will help all prospective students, find the best and most suitable university in the UK to apply for. In addition, it will be a great tool for unviversities to keep tabs on the competition and create a benchmark.
 
## How are we doing that?
* Our main data will be collected from 2 different sources, first source is Kaggle where we will be getting data about university ranking from 2013 till 2021, and the second source will be a web scraping code, that will extract same data for year 2022 from The Guardian website and append it to the main data frame.

* In addition, this data will be deployed on a Postgres SQL server as it’s a structured database and our data contains strictly values without any binary related info.

* This full process will be developed in one centralized code that will curate and cleanse all the data.

* Moving from python, the data will be exported as well to an excel file that will be used as data source for a Tableau dashboard. The report will be published and used as a final product.

* Moreover, we will be using HTML and CSS to develop a website, using a Flask based application and a JavaScript code that will properly create a website with our findings, as well as visualizations, and interactive menus for ease of access.
